### Context
Game developed while following the "Complete C# Unity Developer" online course. I took the lectures as a basis to create something to my own liking and this was the result.

### Description

The objective is to reach for the highest score.

Took inspiration in Dragon Ball :dragon::basketball: and also added many other of my own twists.
